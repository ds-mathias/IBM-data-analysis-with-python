# IBM Data Analysis with Python
Through this IBM certificated course I enhanced my skills with Python for data wrangling, exploratory data analytics, model development and model evaluation. I applied:
- Pandas, Numpy and Scipy libraries to load, manipulate, analyse and visualise large datasets for housing data
- Machine learning regression algorithms using the scikit-learn library to predict housing data
